# Classes and Objects

## 1. What is a Class?

A blueprint for creating objects.

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
```

## 2. Constructors (**init**)

The method that is automatically called when a new object is created.

```python
dog = Dog("Buddy") # Calls __init__
```
