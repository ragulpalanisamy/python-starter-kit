# Python Tuples

Tuples are ordered, **immutable** (unchangeable) collections.

## 1. Tuple Basics

```python
point = (10, 20)
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
```

## 2. Key Features

- **Immutable:** Once created, you cannot change, add, or remove items.
- **Ordered:** Items have a defined order that will not change.
- **Allow Duplicates:** Can have multiple items with the same value.

## 3. Why Use Tuples?

- Faster than lists.
- Used for data that shouldn't change (e.g., coordinates, constants).
- Can be used as keys in dictionaries (unlike lists).
