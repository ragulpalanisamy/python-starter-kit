# What is PEP?

**PEP** stands for **Python Enhancement Proposal**. It is a design document providing information to the Python community or describing a new feature for Python.

## Why is PEP important?

- It ensures a clear structure for Python's evolution.
- It provides documentation for all major changes.
- It allows the community to review and discuss proposals.

## Important PEPs to know

- **PEP 8**: The style guide for Python code (tells you how to format your code).
- **PEP 20**: The Zen of Python (a collection of 19 "guiding principles").
- **PEP 484**: Type Hints (allows you to specify the types of variables).
